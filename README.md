# @logicwind/react-native-status-bar-height

A simple and lightweight React Native package to get the height of the status bar on both Android and iOS.

### Installation

Using npm:

```sh md title="Terminal"
npm install @logicwind/react-native-status-bar-height
```

or using yarn:

```sh md title="Terminal"
yarn add @logicwind/react-native-status-bar-height
```

### iOS Setup

After installation, make sure to install CocoaPods:

```sh md title="Terminal"
cd ios && pod install
```

### Android Setup

No additional setup is required.

## Usage

Import and use the `fetchStatusBarHeight` function to get the status bar height.

```tsx md title="App.tsx"
import { fetchStatusBarHeight } from '@logicwind/react-native-status-bar-height';

const statusBarHeight = fetchStatusBarHeight();
```

## How It Works

- On **iOS**, it attempts to fetch the status bar height using native modules. If unavailable, it falls back to predefined values based on screen dimensions.
- On **Android**, it retrieves `StatusBar.currentHeight`.
